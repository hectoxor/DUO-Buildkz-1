# Chain Tool

This custom-designed tool, also commonly referred to as a "chain break" or "chain breaker", allows teams to easily break and re-assemble #25 Chain (

[REV-41-1365](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1365/)

). The mandrel is used to push out the chain pin. If using Master Links (

[REV-41-1366](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1366/)

), the pin can be completely removed, but the depth guide screw allows the option of partially pressing out the pin and then re-assembling without master links.
