# Timing Belts and Pulleys

When working with the REV GT2 3mm Pitch Pulleys and Belts there will be some difference in pitch between the

Extended Motion Pattern

, featured on the

[Channels](https://www.revrobotics.com/competition/ftc/structure/channel/)

, and the pitch of the Timing Belts. Because of the mismatched pitches, there may be limitations to the getting the perfect center to center distance. One solution to accommodate for this issue is to use a combination of M3 Standoffs (

[REV-41-1492](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1492/)

) and Tensioning Bushings (

[REV-41-1702](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1702/)

) to help tension the belt appropriately.
