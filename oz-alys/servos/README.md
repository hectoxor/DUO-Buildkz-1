# Servos

Servo motors are a specialized kind of motor which can be controlled to move to a specific angle instead of continuously rotating like a DC motor. Instead of a hex output shaft like the DC motor, servos have an output spline. A **spline** is a specific groove pattern cut into the shaft which allows the rotation of the servo motor to be transmitted to the attached Aluminum Servo Horn (

. Splines are like keys, so only matched types will fit together. The REV Robotics Servos all use a 25T spline pattern. If the gears or spline of the REV Robotics Smart Robot Servo (
