# Linear Motion

Linear motion stages can be driven many different ways, but our recommendation is to use a string wound around a pulley and segments of surgical tubing to operate as a powered return. The string and pulley arrangement is used in one of two ways: **Cascading** **or Continuous lifts**. In the

Cascading lift assembly

, all the stages move up simultaneously, each one by an equal amount. In the

Continuous string assembly

only one stage moves at a time and the position of each stage relative to each other is not controlled, only the position of the final stage relative to the start position is controlled. This distinction is not relevant in most applications; however, it is a feature that can be used to great effect and is worth keep in mind during design and prototyping.
