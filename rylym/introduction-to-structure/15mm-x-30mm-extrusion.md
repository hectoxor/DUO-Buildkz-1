# 15mm x 30mm Extrusion

The 15mm x 30mm profile of the

[Extrusion](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/structure/15mm-extrusion/)

has slots on on all four sides that accept standard

[M3 hardware](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/hardware/fasteners/)

. Rather than using a T-nut, which is more expensive, slide a M3 hex head screw along the slot and adjust brackets and other build materials as needed. As illustrated in the image above, the ends of the Extrusion also have a 5mm hole **pitch** that can be M3 tappped. The 15mm x 30mm Extrusion has one slot on each 15mm face and 3 slots on each 30mm face, allowing for some additional design flexibility when compared to the standard 15mm extrusion.
