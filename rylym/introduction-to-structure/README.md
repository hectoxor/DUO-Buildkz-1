. REV Extrusion is a rectangular structure rail with slots for

on all four sides. The slots in the Extrusion allow for brackets and other items to be adjusted to any position along the rail. REV Channel is a larger structural member featuring a pattern for actuators, brackets, and other elements to be placed at set intervals. Channels have a combination of a **fixed pitch based system** (known as the **Extended Motion Pattern**) and an **extrusion system** for design flexibility.
