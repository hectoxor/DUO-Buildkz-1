# 45mm x 45mm U Channel

â€‹

[REV 45mm U Channel](https://www.revrobotics.com/competition/ftc/structure/channel/)

has a 45mm x 45mm square profile, and is designed to work seamlessly with existing

[REV 15mm Extrusion](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/structure/15mm-extrusion/)

. It can be used in locations where additional torsional strength is required. On the sides of the channel is the Extended Motion Pattern which uses

[M3 hardware](https://www.revrobotics.com/ftc/hardware/fasteners/)

for attaching brackets, extrusion, and channel together. Locations for mounting bearings, shafts, motors, and servos are available every 16mm. Slots on the top of the channel accept standard M3 hex-head bolts or nuts, rather than expensive t-nuts. The top of the channel also has the Motion Pattern with M3 holes on a 16mm diameter circle pattern repeating down the channel.
