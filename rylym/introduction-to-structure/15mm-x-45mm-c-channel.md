# 15mm x 45mm C Channel

The 45mm wide side of the channel features the **Extended Motion Pattern** which uses M3 hardware for attaching brackets, extrusion, and channel together. Locations for mounting bearings, shafts, motors, and servos are available every 16mm. Slots on the 15mm sections of the channel accept standard M3 hex-head bolts or nuts, rather than expensive t-nuts.
