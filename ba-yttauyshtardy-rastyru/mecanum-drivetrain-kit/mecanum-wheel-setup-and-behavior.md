# Mecanum Wheel Setup and Behavior

Mecanum wheels, when properly set up on a drivetrain, allow for omni-directional movement. Each Mecanum Wheel Set (

[REV-45-1655](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-45-1655/)

) comes with a two right (REV-41-1656) and two left (REV-41-1657) mecanum wheels. This is determined by the direction of the leading edge of the rollers. If the rollers point left it is a left wheel and if they point right it is a right wheel.
