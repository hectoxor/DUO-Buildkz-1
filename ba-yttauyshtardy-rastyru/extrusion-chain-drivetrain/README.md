# Extrusion Chain Drivetrain

This section outlines the steps required to build a four-wheel, extrusion-based chain drivetrain using parts from the FTC Starter Kit V3 (

[REV-45-1883](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-45-1883/)

). This design is a good starting point. However, modification maybe required to address the specific needs of the robot being designed. This design is flexible, allowing for different wheel types depending on the overall requirements of the drive train.
