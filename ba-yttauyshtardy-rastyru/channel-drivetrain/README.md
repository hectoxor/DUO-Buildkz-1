# Channel Drivetrain

This section outlines the steps required to build a six-wheel, channel-based, differential drivetrain. This design is a good starting point. However, modification maybe required to address the specific needs of the robot being designed. This design is flexible, allowing for different wheel types depending on the overall requirements of the drive train.
