# Class Bot

This section outlines the steps required to build the REV Class Bot using parts from the REV EDU Kit (

[REV-45-1517](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-45-1517/)

). This design is a good starting point for robot design using the REV 15mm Build System. However, modification may be required to address the specific needs of the challenge.
