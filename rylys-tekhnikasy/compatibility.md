# Compatibility

For a system with more shafts, the easiest way to couple between Hex and non-hex shafts is to use #25 pitch chain (

) because it’s common to all systems. In designs with multiple chain stages it’s possible to change any number of the shafts over to hex. The more shafts converted, the less risk of a set-screw skipping and causing a failure. Starting from the motor and then changing subsequent shafts will provide the most benefit, but any shaft that’s converted to hex will reduce a point of failure.
